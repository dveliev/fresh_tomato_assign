#Fresh Tomato Assignment

This is a repo of my assignment for the Udacity`s Fullstack development nanodegree

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Fill in the "movies.txt" and "tvshows.txt" files*
3. Run the init.py file. This will automatically generate an html file

*Movies.txt - You need to provide the name of the film and a youtube link for its trailer. Each one of the movies needs to be on a new line

*Tvshows.txt - You need to provide just the name of the TV Show. Each TV Show name needs to be on a new line
